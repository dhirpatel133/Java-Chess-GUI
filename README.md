# Java-Chess-GUI
Developed the project in grade 11

My very first large scale programming application. It is fully developed in Java using multiple 2-D arrays,
loops, widgets, panels, layouts and classes such as actionPerformed. Coding is done in the Eclpise platform. 
Since this is a GUI and not a CLI, this project does not use I/O, however, I am also comfortable using I/O
as well.
